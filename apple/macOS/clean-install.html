<p>We explain how to reinstall macOS via Recovery here: <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/reinstall-mac-os-recovery-3593641/">How to reinstall macOS</a>, but we will summarise the steps here.</p>
<p>How you enter recovery mode depends on the Mac you own.</p>
<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/how-to-m1-macs-3801104/">enter recovery mode on an M1 or M2-series Mac</a> (or later) you need to press and hold the power button when you start up your Mac and continue to press and hold the button until you see a startup options window appear with an Options icon. Select Options and click Continue.</p>
<p>To enter Recovery on an Intel Mac press Command+R.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once Recovery starts up youâ€™ll see a macOS Utilities window with options to Restore From Time Machine Backup, Reinstall macOS [version], Safari (or Get Help Online in older versions) and Disk Utility. If you want to wipe the Mac before reinstalling choose Disk Utility.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using Disk Utility run through the steps to erase your Mac as detailed in our <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/reinstall-mac-os-recovery-3593641/">How to reinstall macOS</a> guide.</li>
  <li>After you have erased your drive click on Disk Utility &gt; Quit Disk Utility. Or just Command + Q.</li>
  <li>Now choose Reinstall macOS from the options.</li>
  <li>Wait while macOS is reinstalled. Expect this to take a while.</li>
</ol>
